# KL-Expansions for Gaussian Processes

This code provides a Python implementation of Algorithm 1 of

https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05924

for performing 1-dimensional Gaussian process regression using KL-expansions.
The purpose of this code is to provide a 
bare-bones implementation of the algorithm that can be used as 
a template. 

Gaussian process using KL-expansions involves representing a 
Gaussian process as an expansion of the form 

$$ asdf $$

The file `example.py` contains a simple example of Gaussian process
regression, while `kl_exps.py` includes the numerical codes for constructing
KL-expansions and performing regression.
